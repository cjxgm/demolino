# Demolino - A Scripting Demo-making Tool for Linux with OpenGL

Yes, yet another demo-making tool. There are really _NO_ usable
demo-maker for Linux. And most Linux hackers want one. So demolino
comes to help.

If you've ever glanced through my dashboard, you may notice another
demo-making tool made by me: Dewox. That's an _RAD_ one, and this is
_SCRIPTING_ one. That is, Dewox has a GUI to *make* demos, while
Demolino allows you to use your favorite text editor to *write* demos.

## So, why I write demos instead of making ones?

Because you're a hacker! (Or you may not like Demolino)

Mouse sucks in most cases to a hacker's view. And, to me, it's easier
to write a compiler than GUI. So I may maintance this more actively
than Dewox, with many new features not yet supported by Dewox appearing
here.

## Anything more?

Sorry, but I'm busy preparing for the mid-term exams and I have so
little time these days that I cannot describe more for now. But I'll
do it later after the mid-term exams.
